# Solutions to problems on projecteuler.net

I solved the first 10 problems in Python to unlock the user solution thread and
the overview PDF. I then either improved the solutions using the overview or
looked up Haskell solutions from the user thread. Therefore, the Haskell
solutions in this repository are not the ones I used to initially answer the
problems.
